6. General
We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current
version of the Terms, which will always be at meetapt.com/tos, will govern our relationship with you. We
will try to notify you of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the email
associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become
effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
The laws of the State of Georgia, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any
dispute that arises between you and Apt Enterprise Solutions, Inc. All disputes related to these Terms or
the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Rockdale County, Georgia,
United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your
official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then
those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action
related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict
of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the
State of California (excluding choice of law).
In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision
will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these
Terms will remain in full force and effect. Apt's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
These Terms are an agreement between you and Apt Enterprise Solutions, Inc., 2631 Wellington Way,
Conyers, GA 30013 U.S.A. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.
